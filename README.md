# CPSC583FinalProject


The repository contains a ipynb file that stores all the codes for the project.


The ipynb file will automatically download necessary dependecies if you run the first three cells.


Run all the cells to see the results of running 3 times of GIN network trained with 5 epoches, 3 times of GIN with attention network trained with 5 epoches, summary of the GIN with attention model, visualization of ogbg-molhiv dataset, and a final result of GIN with attention network trained with 50 epoches.
